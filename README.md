- Submit small pull requests to open-source projects
- Publish a Python package or small tool
- Share code snippets or fixes online
- Improve documentation for libraries you use

---

# 🌟 7. “Power Items” That Make Your Portfolio Stand Out

These are rare for high schoolers and extremely impressive:
- Release an app on the App Store/Play Store
- Publish a game on Itch.io or Steam
- Build and ship a custom PCB
- Publish a dataset or simple AI model
- Hardware hacking/mod projects
- YouTube tutorial series documenting your builds
- Internship at a local tech shop, maker space, or repair shop

# 🎯 8. Four-Year Growth Plan

## **Freshman Year**
- 5–10 small coding projects  
- 1–2 hardware builds  
- Start GitHub consistency  
- First tiny freelance gig  

## **Sophomore Year**
- 2 medium software projects
   - Full 2d pygame game  
- 2 medium hardware projects  
- 1–2 competitions  
- Begin open-source involvement  

## **Junior Year**
- 1 advanced project (AI, robotics, full app)  
- More freelance/contract work  
- Publish something publicly (app/game/site)  

## **Senior Year**
- Major “capstone” project  
- Fully polished portfolio website  
- Resume with years of real projects

# 📦 Goal
By the time you graduate, this collection becomes a complete portfolio showcasing:
- Real world experience  
- Software and hardware skills  
- Consistent growth  
- Entrepreneurial mindset  
- Projects across multiple tech areas  

This puts you far ahead of typical college students and makes you competitive for internships, freelance work, or even entry-level tech roles.

---

# ✔ How to Use This Repo
- Add new ideas as issues  
- Turn each project into its own folder  
- Track progress in a `progress.md` file  
- Commit weekly even if small  
- Add screenshots, demos, and write-ups as you go  

---

If you want, I can also generate a **README badge section**, **table of contents**, or even turn this into a polished **Notion-style document**.  
Just tell me!
